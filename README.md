# SRAM ZBT FPGA-based controller

This projects aims at creating a FPGA-based controller for a ZBT-type SRAM.


## Implementations

Two implementations are offered for comparison:
* the first one is a C implementation, which can be synthethized into VHDL/Verilog using Vitis HLS;
* the second one is a direct native VHDL implementation on Vivado.


## Quick comparison betwwen the implementations

**TBD**
